## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- AWS Amplify CLI installed globally
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage resources
- A TMDb API key

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```
Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-collection.git
```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```
Copy code

cd movie-search-collection
```

1. Install the dependencies:

```
Copy code

npm install
```

1. Configure AWS Amplify:

```
Copy code

amplify init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your AWS Amplify project.

1. Add authentication:

```
Copy code

amplify add auth
```

Choose the default configuration for authentication.

1. Create the necessary API and database resources:

```
Copy code

amplify add api
```

Select GraphQL as the API service and follow the prompts to create the required schema and resolvers.

1. Push the changes to AWS:

```
Copy code

## Important Notes

- Make sure to handle errors and edge cases properly in the application.
- Implement proper loading states and error messages to enhance the user experience.
- Regularly update the dependencies to ensure compatibility and security.
- Follow best practices for React development, including component reusability, prop typing, and performance optimization.
- Implement proper testing using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application's stability and reliability.
- Consider implementing pagination or infinite scrolling for large movie datasets to improve performance.
- Optimize API calls by caching frequently accessed data to reduce the number of requests and improve response times.
- Ensure sensitive information, such as API keys and AWS credentials, is not exposed in the client-side code.
- Regularly monitor and review the AWS resources used by the application to avoid unexpected costs and ensure proper scaling.
